# ❤️ Our Valentine's Portal

I wanted to take my coding skills and turn them into something meaningful that we can keep as a digital memory.

## ✨ The Experience
I designed this to be a fun, interactive surprise. The "No" button is programmed to playfully dodge any attempts to click it, because in my heart, there’s only one answer I’m looking for! Once the "Yes" is clicked, it’s officially logged into our digital scrapbook.

## 🛠️ How it Works
I built this using a full-stack approach to make sure it was more than just a simple webpage:
* **The Heart (Python & Flask):** Manages the server and ensures every "Yes" is saved.
* **The Interaction (JavaScript):** Creates the playful movement of the buttons.
* **The Connection (Ngrok):** Allowed me to send this straight to your phone so you could see it anywhere.
* **The Gallery (Static Assets):** Holds our favorite photo (`US.jpg`) that makes this site ours.

## 🛠️ How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install flask`
2. Run the server: `python valentines.py`
3. Expose via tunnel: `ngrok http 5000`

## 📂 Project Memory
* `/templates`: The visual design of our portal.
* `/static`: Where our photo is safely kept.
* `valentines.py`: The logic that runs the whole surprise.
* `responses.csv`: The permanent record of your "Yes!"
Note: The application will automatically create a `responses.csv` file to log interactions when first run.
